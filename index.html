    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Alzhan. I have more than 15 years of working experience in
      the field of project management. However, recently I decided to gain new
      valuable skills in programming. Currently, I am mastering my knowledge and
      skills in Java Script and learning how to use GitHub. Also, hopefully this
      year, I will learn how to become a front-end engineer.
    </p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>
      Most of my experience come from Kazakhstan. I worked in public and private
      sectors, as well as in international organizations.
