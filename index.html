          <p>
            Hi! My name is Alzhan. I have more than 15 years of working experience in
            the field of project management. However, recently I decided to gain new
            valuable skills in programming. Currently, I am mastering my knowledge and
            skills in Java Script and learning how to use GitHub. Also, hopefully this
            year, I will learn how to become a front-end engineer.
          </p>
